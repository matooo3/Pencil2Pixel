# Pencil2Pixel

## Introduction
Welcome to our Pencil to Pixel project!
We generate art in various styles, based on your sketch and promt!
To be able to do this, we use Text-to-Image Diffusion Models based on Stable Diffusion-XL.


Here are some examples of what it could look like:

Prompt: A paper airplane flying through pink clouds, birds in the backgrounds, 4k, photorealistic

Input sketch:

<img src="https://github.com/matooo3/Pencil2Pixel/blob/main/examples/airplane_sketch.png" alt="Input sketch" width="400"/>

Output:

<img src="https://github.com/matooo3/Pencil2Pixel/blob/main/examples/out_sketch_airplane8.png" alt="Output" width="400"/>



## Setup
To set up this project, you need to have Python (Add min. Version here?) installed.

We recommend using a virtual environment like [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/).

Then you need to download all of the packages we use. To do this, just type:
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (We still need to create that file).
